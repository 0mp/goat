.Sh NAME
.Nm goat
.Nd POSIX-compliant shell movement boosting hack for real ninjas
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm delete Op Ar shortcut ...
.Nm
.Cm deleteprefix Ar prefix
.Nm
.Cm fix
.Nm
.Cm help
.Nm
.Cm link Ar shortcut Ar destination
.Nm
.Cm list

.Nm
.Cm version
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility to manage
.Xr alias 1 Ns -like shortcuts to be used with
.Xr cd 1
in interactive shell sessions.
.Pp
.Nm
intercepts
.Xr cd 1
calls
.Pq e.g. Dq Li cd Em newdirectory
by redefining it as a shell function, which implements the following behavior:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Try to switch the current working directory to
.Em newdirectory
if possible
.Pq which is the standard Xr cd 1 behavior .
.It
Unless the previous step was successful, interpret
.Em newdirectory
as a
.Nm
.Em shortcut
and follow the
.Em link
to change the current working directory.
.El
.Pp
Invoking
.Nm
without any arguments is equivalent to
.Dq Li goat list .
.Pp
Additionally,
.Nm
extends the standard
.Xr cd 1
handling of switching to the parent directory
.Pq e.g. Dq Li cd ..
by allowing for specifying more than two dots
.Pq e.g. Dq Li cd .... .
Every third and subsequent dot is replaced with
.Dq Li ../ .
This way
.Dq Li cd ....
is equivalent to
.Dq Li cd ../../../ .
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "version"
.It Cm delete Op Ar shortcut ...
Delete
.Ar shortcut
so that the link between
.Ar shortcut
and the associated destination directory is removed.
.It Cm deleteprefix Ar prefix
Delete all the shortcuts associated with directories, which start with the
given
.Ar prefix .
.It Cm fix
Remove shortcuts, which point to non-existing directories.
.It Cm help
Show help.
.It Cm link Ar shortcut Ar destination
Create a symbolic link between
.Ar shortcut
and
.Ar destination .
The link is going to be created in the directory pointed by the
.Ev GOAT_PATH
environmental variable.
The
.Cm link
keyword is usually optional, i.e.,
.Dq Li goat shortcut dest
is sufficient if it doesn't conflict with other
.Nm
commands.
The link is created for the absolute path of the
.Ar destination
directory.
Always succeeds.
.It Cm list
Show a list of all shortcuts.
.It Cm nuke
Delete all shortcuts.
.It Cm version
Show version.
.El
.Sh GLOSSARY
.Bl -tag -width destination
.It Em destination
A directory pointed to by a
.Em shortcut .
.It Em link
A relation based on symbolic links between a
.Em shortcut
and a
.Em destination .
.It Em shortcut
A symbolic link file stored in
.Ev GOAT_PATH
that is associated with a certain
.Em destination .
When its name is specified as an argument to
.Xr cd 1
it causes
.Nm
to change the working directory to the
.Em destination
associated with the
.Em shortcut .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev GOAT_PATH
The directory where
.Nm
shortcuts are stored.
Overwrites
.Ev XDG_HOME_CONFIG .
.It Ev XDG_HOME_CONFIG Pq default: Dq Pa ~/.config
The directory prefix where
.Nm
shortcuts are stored.
For example, setting
.Ev XDG_HOME_CONFIG
to
.Dq Pa ~/settings
results in
.Nm
looking for its
.Em shortcuts
in
.Pa ~/settings/goat .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ~/.config/goat
.It Pa ~/.config/goat
The directory where
.Em shortcuts
are stored unless
.Ev GOAT_PATH
is set to a different directory.
The
.Dq Pa ~/.config
prefix can be modified by setting
.Ev XDG_CONFIG_HOME .
.It Pa "%%LIBDIR%%/libgoat.sh"
The file, which redefines
.Xr cd 1 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a shortcut named
.Dq f
to
.Pa ~/Documents/dev/freebsd
(no need to use
the
.Cm link
command explicitly here):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ goat f ~/Documents/dev/freebsd
.Ed
.Pp
Follow a link to change a directory with
.Xr cd 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ cd f
.Ed
.Pp
Take the
.Dq f
shortcut and enter its destination subdirectory with just one command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ pwd
/home/0mp
$ cd f/ports
$ pwd
/usr/home/0mp/freebsd/ports
.Ed
.Pp
Create a shortcut named
.Dq p
to the current directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ goat p .
.Ed
.Pp
Go up the filesystem tree with
.Cm ...
.Po
same as the standard
.Dq Li cd ../../
.Pc :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ cd ...
.Ed
.Pp
List all your links:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ goat list
dots    ->      /usr/home/0mp/.dotfiles
down    ->      /usr/home/0mp/Downloads
f       ->      /usr/home/0mp/freebsd
p       ->      /usr/home/0mp/freebsd/ports
pa      ->      /usr/home/0mp/freebsd/patches
src     ->      /usr/home/0mp/freebsd/svn/src
svn     ->      /usr/home/0mp/freebsd/svn
.Ed
.Pp
Delete a link (or more):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ goat delete f p
.Ed
.Pp
Delete all the links which point to directories with the given prefix:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ goat deleteprefix "$HOME/Documents"
.Ed
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
.Nm
has no known compatibility issues.
.Pp
.Nm
should work just fine with MinGW environments.
