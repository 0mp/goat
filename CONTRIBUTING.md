# Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.

- Variables intented to be used as global variables should look like this:

  ```sh
  gGLOBAL_VARIABLE
  ```

- Constant variables like directory names should be declared like this:

  ```sh
  readonly kCONSTANT_VARIABLE='constant value'
  ```

- Variables should be always put in double quotes if possible.

- Every string should be put in single quotes by default or double quotes if
  needed.
